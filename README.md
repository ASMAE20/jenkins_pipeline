# jenkins_pipeline
This is a Jenkins pipeline that i utilized with a script file 'script.groovy' to perform the pipeline stages. The pipeline is executed on any available agent and utilizes the Maven tool. The pipeline consists of four stages: Init, Build Jar, Build Image, and Deploy. In the Init stage, the script file is loaded into a variable 'gv' for use in subsequent stages. In the Build Jar stage, the 'buildJar()' function in the script file is executed to build a jar file. In the Build Image stage, the 'buildImage()' function in the script file is executed to build a Docker image. Finally, in the Deploy stage, the 'deployApp()' function in the script file is executed to deploy the application. The code is written in Groovy and is organized into stages with clear steps and appropriate comments.
